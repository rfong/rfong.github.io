<h1>Physical Spam Detection</h1>
<p class="subtitle">I filmed and produced this April Fool's release while working on the robotics team at OpenAI, the antijoke being that we actually did all the research (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06907">published here</a>) described in <a href="https://blog.openai.com/spam-detection-in-the-physical-world/">the April Fool's post</a>.</p>

<h1>Slinky People</h1>
<p class="subtitle">Collab with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/BananaNeil">banananeil</a> after I wrote <a href="https://gist.github.com/rfong/1627a348dd8e8655f0647ccb4c7adae2">a script to live-transform us into slinky people by time-delaying successive slices of a webcam capture.</a></p>

<h1>Preparing for Pi(e) Day</h1>
<p class="subtitle">I co-produced the 2014 announcement video for MIT admit day (which is never <i>not</i> on Pi Day) by pieing all the active admissions bloggers in the face on a below-freezing afternoon in Cambridge. This kicked off a long and illustrious dynasty of increasingly elaborate Pi Day videos.</p>
